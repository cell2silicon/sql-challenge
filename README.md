SQL Homework
In this challenge, we have to make tables for all the data bases and then organise in a way so that we have primary keys and foreigh keys set.
I created titles, employees and departments table first in order, and then used the primary keys in these tables to be used as foreign keys in the rest of the tables.
In employee department table and manager derpartment table I have used composite keys.
After the tables were created, I created ERD within PG admin.
Once all the tables were created, & ERD was created, I impotrted the data from the csv files in the data.
Once all of that was done I wrote scripts to get the data as required in the activity.

# Bonus
In Bonus, I created the engine to create a path with the SQL database and python. 
Once that was done, I merged the necessary dataframes and got the results.
Once i had those results, I plotted histogram and bar plot.
