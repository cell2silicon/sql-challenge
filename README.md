<br /> SQL Homework
<br /> 1. In this challenge, we have to make tables for all the data bases and then organise in a way so that we have primary keys and foreigh keys set.
<br /> 2. I created titles, employees and departments table first in order, and then used the primary keys in these tables to be used as foreign keys in the rest of the tables.
<br /> 3. In employee department table and manager derpartment table I have used composite keys.
<br /> 4. After the tables were created, I created ERD within PG admin.
<br /> 5. Once all the tables were created, & ERD was created, I impotrted the data from the csv files in the data.
<br /> 6. Once all of that was done I wrote scripts to get the data as required in the activity.

# Bonus
<br /> 1. In Bonus, I created the engine to create a path with the SQL database and python. 
<br /> 2. Once that was done, I merged the necessary dataframes and got the results.
<br /> 3. Once i had those results, I plotted histogram and bar plot.
